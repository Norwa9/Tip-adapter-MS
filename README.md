# TiP-Adapter: Training-free CLIP-Adapter for Better Vision-Language Modeling
This is the official code release for the paper ['TiP-Adapter: Training-free CLIP-Adapter for Better Vision-Language Modeling'](https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.03930).
## Introduction
Tip-Adapter provides faster convergence and better performance than CLIP-Adapter by initializing the adapter with a cache model.

## Implementation
Put ``tip_adapter_ImageNet.py`` into clip's folder and run 

    python tip_adapter_ImageNet.py

you will get 65.51% on ImageNet validation set.

This repo will be completed in a few days.
